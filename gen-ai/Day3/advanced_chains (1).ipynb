As a biryani enthusiast, I was excited to try what I hoped would be a delightful dish, but unfortunately, it fell far short of expectations.\\n\\nFirstly, the flavor profile was lacking. A good biryani should have a balanced blend of spices that tantalize the palate, but what I received was bland and uninspiring. The chicken was overcooked and dry, which made it difficult to enjoy. Instead of succulent pieces infused with rich flavors, I was met with an unappetizing texture.\\n\\nAdditionally, the rice was undercooked and clumped together, making it a challenge to serve. There was little to no aroma that one typically associates with freshly made biryani. Presentation-wise, it didn’t look appealing either, which is quite important for such a beloved dish.\\n\\nThe portion size was decent, but if the food itself isn't good, it doesn't matter how much you get. I really wanted to enjoy this meal, but it ended up being a waste of my money and time.\\n\\nOverall, I was left feeling unsatisfied and unlikely to return. I had higher hopes for Akbar Biryani, but sadly, this experience has led me to reconsider ordering from them in the future. If you're in search of a flavorful biryani experience, I would recommend looking elsewhere.\",\n",
       " 'comment': \"Thank you for sharing your experience. It's always tough when a place you hope will deliver let you down. Biryani is such a cherished dish, and it sounds like Akbar Biryani missed the mark on several key elements. It's especially disappointing when the fundamentals like flavor, texture, and presentation aren’t up to par. Have you tried any other biryani spots that you found to be better? It might be worth exploring new places to find that perfect bowl of biryani!\",\n",
